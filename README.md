###### There is nothing more satisfying than a neat, sorted set of silverware. Practice your coordination skills and start sorting today. The silverware is ready. Are you?

## Game Highlights:
Silverware Sorter is a fast-paced sorting game that will put your hand-eye coordination to the test. You have 17 seconds to sort as many pieces of unsorted silverware as possible.

- Improve your hand-eye coordination with rapid sorting of randomly generated silverware
- Exercise your brain and fidget throughout the day to remain mentally focused
- Feel the silverware snap into place with custom haptic feedback
- Prove you're the most organized of your friends and show off your new high score
- Sort during the day or night with stunning light and dark mode designs
- Choose your favorite controller: Available on iPhone and iPad

This is silverware like you've never seen it before. Do you have what it takes to be the next Supreme Silverware Sorter?

## Prerequisites
Silverware Sorter is designed for iPhone and iPad and coming soon to the Mac. Version 1.0 equires an iOS device running iOS 14+.

## Development Process
Codenamed "Project Triple S", Silverware Sorter was conceived, designed, and developed over the week of October 28 - November 3 2020. I built the application with the goal of sharpening SwiftUI skills and learning the foundations of iOS game development compared to general app development. The application was written entirely in Swift with SwiftUI and Xcode 12.0. Using a Notion workspace, I managed a kanban board for the project from start to finish over the 6 day period following strict deadlines and priorities to practice Agile project management. Project Triple S utilized Git and GitHub for source control, and the app was fully tested and reviewed before completion.
Many challenges arose during development such as silverware struggling to fit into the proper parent view and constant @State changes causing heavy lag. As a relatively new framework, it became difficult to debug SwiftUI build and runtime errors. After constant trial and error and with the help of Hacking with Swift and online developer forums, tweaks to the storage of @State variables and view hierarchy produced a fluid user interface that looks gorgeous across device types and screen sizes.

## Authors
This application was designed, developed, and tested by Sam Blum. At the time of this publication, Sam is a 20 year old junior studying Computer Science and Engineering Management at Vanderbilt University. He is a lifelong Apple enthusiast and began teaching himself the Swift Programming Language for designing native iOS apps during his senior year of high school. He continued learning how to code when he took his first Java programming course at Vanderbilt in the spring of his freshman year. At Vanderbilt, he has learned fundamental software engineering principles in C++ and aims to continue spending personal development time working in SwiftUI over the course of the 2020-2021 school year. Sam is currently an [Apple Developer](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/sam-blum/id1448067874) and spent the summer of 2020 as an iOS Engineer Intern at Apple. 

## Acknowledgments
As the roommate who enjoys doing the dishes and sorting clean silverware, I considered the idea of Silverware Sorter on a lively weekday night in October 2020. The satisfaction of organizing and neatly storing silverware seemed like a fantastic game candidate, and I am always looking for new, fun SwiftUI ideas to develop. Weeks after completing my [- Steve iOS 14 Widget](https://github.com/samblum17/Project-Barb), I was ready for the next challenge, and Silverware Sorter was born.

I would like to thank Apple for the abundance of documentation and resources on SwiftUI. Thank you to Paul Hudson from Hacking with Swift for publishing super useful, free SwiftUI guides. I would like to thank Dani Klafter, Anshul Joshi, Jake Gordon, and Jai Bansal for guiding UI design decisions throughout development. And finally, as always, I'd like to thank my family for pushing me to continue learning and working hard, even when it gets tough.
Grit, humility, and a constant drive to never be satisfied push me to seek new opportunities every day. I'm extremely proud of the special place this project will hold in my heart, and I look forward to creating many more fun projects in the coming months. Thank you for checking out Silverware Sorter, and have fun sorting!
